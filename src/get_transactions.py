def get_all_transactions(access_token, verbose=False):
    """Retrieves all transactions since the account was created. 
    Saves results in a JSON file: 'transactions.json'.

    Multiple calls must be made because Monzo's API allows the maximum 
    time between the 'since' and 'before' parametrs to be 8760 hours 
    (365 days) [1]. Additionally, the maximum number of transactions we 
    can receive in a single API call is 100 [2]. It's quite likely that 
    a user will have more than 100 transactions per year though, so the 
    time window will probably be the limiting factor.
